Ampule?\n- We learned everything about their Singularity, from its origin to its production methods, but after they put us through the memory wipe procedure, I’m the only one who remembers it. I decided to lay low and pretend that the procedure worked. Even with my limited knowledge of the City, I felt like that this information was probably pretty important.\n- I usually don’t show these notes to the Sinners anyway, but… I'll have to be extra careful about it from now on."

The procedure ended when the Sinners walked out with all their relevant memories wiped.\n- Odd. I remember everything that K Corp wanted me to forget, but that room… I can’t remember a thing about the memory wipe procedure itself.\n- This leaves me with so many questions. Why didn’t the procedure work on me? If it didn’t work, why can’t I remember anything about the memory wipe procedure itself?"

I’ve never actually been to T Corp. Nest before, so I’m not sure how true to life that experience was.\n- They seem to value technology and inventions.\n- The whole Nest is literally monochromatic. I think having any color is a privilege permitted only to those with power. Black fumes constantly spewing out of numerous buildings have darkened its skies."

It can meld together two items of entirely different nature into one, as though they've always been a part of each other.\n- Somehow, the power of the resonance tuning fork melded guns and monstrous crabs called Trash Crabs together. They could use those melded firearms as though they were naturally born with them.\n- U Corp. is scattered across the Great Lake, with most of its major institutions located on its surface.\n- Which means that we’re in dire need of a ship if we want to go anywhere in U Corp. So we got Mephistopheles modified into a ship using the resonance tuning fork.\n- Seems to me that it overlaps this other region called ‘the Outskirts’… Hmm."

I don’t know enough about the City to connect these dots or make any meaningful guesses from them, so I’ll just write down what I heard and put a pin in it for now."

The City is tight with brimming buildings in both heaven and earth, their labyrinthine construction and the Singularities paint a picture hidden afore a screen…”.

Branches once used to manage their Abnormalities.\n- I think there are some conditions and risks to using those E.G.O equipment like the weapons or the armor. Makes sense, since they’re extracted from the Abnormalities that Lobotomy Corp. used to manage. They also seem to affect their users’ mood or speech patterns.\n- Considering that they’re made from Abnormalities… they might pose a problem during our future visits to the Lobotomy Corp. Branches."

Unlike the Fixer Offices with various specializations, though, people refer to these specifically as Workshops.\n- Primarily, they craft and sell weapons, armor, and other tools that Fixers use. Sometimes they’re contracted to build custom gear as well. At least that’s the impression I got.\n- Considering that they’re also run by Fixers, Workshops don’t shy away from taking contracts involving combat if they have to. Like the Rosespanner Workshop did, for example."

The bus really transformed into a boat.\nI guess this is what the ‘additional functions’ meant…\nFurther modifications and performance upgrades were made possible by using both the resonance tuning fork and Mephistopheles’ engine. (That Mika person was in a constant state of astonishment, now that I think about it.)\nHeck, it’s bigger on the inside than it is outside. I won’t be surprised if all kinds of fantastical functions get added to it in the future."

It’s divided by straight lines into several smaller sections, all of which have unique colors. I’ve seen only a little bit of it, but it reminds me of patchwork fabric.\n- According to Ishmael, looks like the Great Lake’s chock full of treacherous natural disasters and monsters.\nEven if she’s right, that it might be too early for us to go to the Great Lake… It's not like we've got much say in the matter. Limbus Company ordered us to go in that direction, so we gotta.\n- I guess that decision’s what got us into this mess… I’m still not sure what I’m supposed to do.\n- In a way, I guess we should consider ourselves lucky. Nothing disastrous has happened yet. Maybe we’re still in the coastal area Ishmael mentioned."

Faust explained that whoever we end up extracting during this period will be relevant to all of us. Relevant… to Limbus Company’s current state in some way.\n- Walpurgis Night seems to arrive once in a while. As usual, Faust doesn’t tell me everything, but at least I could tell that the next Walpurgis Night will be different from this one."
