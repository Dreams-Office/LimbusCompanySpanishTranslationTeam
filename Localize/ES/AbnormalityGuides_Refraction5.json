          "story": "Performing the post-mortem report as ordered by the Executive Manager.\n\nThe entity was encountered around 1040 hours today.\n\nIt assumes the form of a gigantic skull, which explains our ease of identifying this enemy.\n\n(Heavy breathing) The size of the skull is rather intimidating, and it features what appears to be a support of sorts that looks like a spine surrounded by ribs.\n\nThough I may be making a rather large leap in logic here… (Heavy breathing) it can be assumed that the rest of its shape is not so dissimilar to that of human bone structure.\n\nInitially, we had attempted to exploit the equivalents of the usual weaknesses identified on human bodies based on this similarity. However…\n\n… once we observed its extendable spine (Heavy breathing) and morphing of its ribs into arm or wing-like forms, the plan was immediately discarded.\n\nOnce again, it holds true that(Heavy breathing) tactics based on the normal understanding of the common senses(Heavy breathing) are not always useful against these monsters. It wasn’t all for nothing, however.\n\nIn the process of analyzing this foe, we were able to identify a dark entity of humanoid figure within its body(Heavy breathing). While its exact functions are yet to be identified, our current assumption leads us to believe that it may be the entity’s main form, or its core.\n\nI presume that its means of aggression will primarily prioritize attacks of physical nature using its bone structures, but… on account of the lack of evidence, I cannot say for certain.\n\nAny missing information will be(Heavy breathing) supplemented by subsequent observations; please consult this guide in your(Heavy breathing) future commands.\n\nThank you.\n\n→ Damn… by the book as always. How'd you even bring your whole template to a voice recording?\n\n→ Easily. It is a skill to be expected from those in service of the Executive Manager.\n\n→ Yeah, I bet… Take some time to breath though, huh? There was a distracting amount of ‘Heavy breathing’ in this report.\n\n→ Hmph. Must be the nervous breathing of inexperienced chicks. I, Outis, do not let such simple reports take my breath away.\n\n→ I-it wasn’t me. It’s been coming from that skull the moment we found it…\n\n→ Hmm. It has not the lungs nor the trachea, yet it breathes. Through where does its air travel, one wonders—how utterly bizarre."

          "story": "We engaged with the entity in a meaningful capacity around 1100 hours today.\n\nIts first actions in battle were to attempt to strike us physically using its bones. Just as we had expected.\n\nIts most prominent form of attack involved extending its spine to maul its foes with its sizable jaws. However, another, unexpected form of attack was also observed.\n\nIt intermittently lets out a breath. The exhale carried an extraordinary level of shock and air pressure that dealt rather significant damage to any Sinners who were caught directly in its blast radius.\n\nOur allies are far from the most reliable martial force, but a numerical disadvantage may easily lead to fatal results; please do take this advice into account.\n\nHowever… it does not seem that this entity requires a high level of strategizing to defeat. Maintaining high pressure should be more than enough.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind: after some time, it released a large volume of ‘air’ by exhaling.\n\nThe ‘air’ seemed to improve the poise of whomever breathed it in, enhancing the keenness of their attacks. This is when the shadow entity within the skull began to mobilize, attempting to steal the ‘air’ from all those who had it.\n\nVarious strategies were attempted to stop this process, but they were to no avail.\n\nThe most optimal, and the only strategy against losing this air would be to ensure that every unit individually resist the entity to the best of their abilities.\n\nThe entity’s attacks became highly augmented once it inhaled a large volume of this air; preventing this outcome must be the primary objective of this battle.\n\nConcluding the report.\n\nThank you.\n\n→ Recognition of 'Heavy breathing' was disabled in this report for the sake of legibility. However, the ‘Heavy breathing’ records of the previous report will not be removed in service of enhancing the sense of realism of the earlier report.\n\n→ Oh, yeah. The shadowy humanoid dragged Gregor in earlier… are you okay?\n\n→ … It’s not a good time, fellas. I thought the thing was tearing me apart limb from limb."

          "story": "I write to inform you that further intel has been gathered during our encounter with the entity.\n\nIt was learned that, upon losing its ribs, the entity begins to prepare a highly fatal attack.\n\nHowever, with the elimination of its protective skeleton, its defenses become highly porous, meaning that it became much more susceptible to our assaults.\n\nOn the other hand, while not destroying the ribs would inevitably lead to a prolonged battle, it would save us the trouble of having to come up with countermeasures against highly dangerous attacks.\n\nMm. This moment calls for a strategic judgment call.\n\nI have faith in the Executive Manager that, as they have always done, they would come up with an excellent decision that takes the entity’s behaviors and other battlefield factors into account.\n\nThus, I leave this part of the battle to the Executive Manager’s brilliant strategic mind.\n\nConcluding the report.\n\nThank you.\n\n→ Cool… thanks.\n\n→ Is it just me, or does Dante seem a lot less… enthusiastic when replying to Outis?\n\n→ No, no… that’s not what’s happening here! I’m very enthusiastic.\n\n→ Your alienation tactics will fail to drive even the smallest wedge between the Executive Manager and myself. Your efforts are for naught.\n\n→ No… I don’t think that’s what she’s trying to do either. Anyways, I want you to know that I really do appreciate these detailed reports…"

It’s summoning allies now… just to kill them? What?\n\n→ W-what the hell… He’s the old G Corp. Head Manager, isn’t he? What’s going on here?\n\n→ This is the Refraction Railway.

If you wanna be technical about it, lad.\n\n→ … But why? A fool you may be, but you are not one to revel in the Executive Manager’s suffering.\n\n→ What the hell are you prattling on about? Look, I ain’t saying that I like watching Clockhead suffer, it’s…\n\n→ Young Heathcliff… ‘tis a foul habit to find joy in the suffering of others.\n\n→ Agh! You’re all getting it wrong! Oi, manager!
