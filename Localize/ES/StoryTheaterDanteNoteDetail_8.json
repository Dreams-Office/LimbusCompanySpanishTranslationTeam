When Catherine, Nelly, and Heathcliff from the Mirror World gazed into the Mirror, they only saw all kinds of tragedies in their futures. If there really are worlds of infinite possibilities, then… there must be an infinity of time they have to observe, right? So, can we really say that they saw every possible future? In other words, is it even possible to do something like that? It makes me wonder if we can actively interact or something with the Mirror Worlds.\n- We make use of these Mirror technologies almost daily, but we know so little about it. Yi Sang also said that Mirror Worlds are like a terribly tangled knot of mysteries we must carefully unravel."

It doesn’t make sense—our main business, at least on the surface, is Distortion Management… but we’re selling items that can make Distortions? … Maybe we’re just building our reputation as Distortion experts so we can guarantee safety even with these artifacts. Well… if we’re selling artifacts that create Distortions, and take care of Distortions when it inevitably causes someone to Distort… I guess that makes a business model with a cycle of profit."

Meursault listed off all kinds of canned items, and I was able to learn that there were a lot of them.\n- Various flyers covered the train station walls and pillars from top to bottom. Is something awful going on here, I wonder?"

Maybe we can make use of their services one day? Sounds pretty convenient.\n- After a brief conversation with the Identity, I learned that Poludnitsa, the AI, greatly empowers its users if they determine that it may be difficult to make the delivery on time. Failure to make punctual deliveries could result in death… no wonder they rarely ever miss the deadline."

We even ran into the Yurodiviye terrorists using various inventions to cause trouble in the T Corp. Nest.\n- The Yurodiviye, who venerate Sonya as their ‘Saint’, said they’re waiting for the ‘right moment’. I don’t know why they’re calling Sonya the Saint, or what moment they’re talking about… but something about it rubs me the wrong way.\n- From what I gathered from listening to the Dieci Identities, Sonya is not the same kind of ‘Saint’ as the Dieci Association’s."

Maybe it’s kinda like the Backdoor of Mephistopheles.\n- The size and capacity of each dimensional case depend on the make. The more expensive it is, the bigger its capacity, and smaller its external size.\n- We can’t stuff a person into these dimensional cases, apparently. Maybe it’s like the WARP trains where it needs to differentiate between people and items."
