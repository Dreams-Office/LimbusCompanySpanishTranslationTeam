Speeding up time like the T Corp. employees do, rapidly healing his wounds by accelerating the recovery process...\n\nThe most interesting thing in his arsenal, though, was the Time Razor he cut me with at the Clock Tower. It can cut straight through time while leaving the flesh intact. I wonder how that works?\n\nI carefully listened to the Time Rippers talk amongst one another, but I don't think they knew either. I guess I did learn that the deeper they cut, the more time they can take, but that's about it.\n\nThankfully, the Razor didn't seem to affect me one bit because I was bound to the manager's time. The other Sinners, too~\n\nI don't really understand what it means to be 'bound to the manager's time', but... Mm. Well, I suppose we'll all be okay as long as Dante's safe and sound!\n\nOh, also... he didn't hoard all that ripped time to himself, either.\n\nAfter we closed the case, I asked some people in T Corp., and they told me that he embraced the brains of those who agreed with his philosophy. He always shared everything equally among themselves, whether it was the time they ripped or the time they had to spend.\n\nOhh, that explains why the Rippers were able to move independently from the main body. It looked as though they had fused into a single Distortion... but in truth, they each retained their own intelligence.\n\nAnd this is just my guess, but maybe his experience in the Yurodiviye influenced how his Distortion manifested?\n\nThat makes me wonder if this is a distorted, degraded form of the belief that things should be shared equally...\n\nWell, all in all, it didn't seem to have worked out~ It would've been a much harder fight if they actually managed to divide the time equally amongst one another. I'd say we got lucky!\n\nThough I guess you could also say that they were bound to eventually fall apart, given the fact that they ended up fighting each other towards the end.\n\n→ People like equal share until they have to give up something of theirs. That's just the way most people are.\n\n→ Well, so much for that intimidating moniker, huh? That fella had an impressive power at his disposal, but the person behind that power wasn't anyone special.\n\n→ M.I.D.D.L.I.N.G. (somebody scribbled the following note in the margins: Morality Ignored and Deserted Due to Luxury, Integrity: Naturally Gone.)\n\n→ Yeah~ even the Time Ripper wasn't anyone special. Unlike me, who's... (the text trails off, as though someone hesitated writing further before abandoning the idea)"
