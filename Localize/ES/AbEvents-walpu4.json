It wasn't long before the same bullets from earlier struck us.\n\nRed barriers began to form around the Sinners who were struck by the bullets.\n\n'Let's see... According to the schedule, we have some time until the next Noon arrives.'\n\nOne of the Sinners noticed an Emergency Response manual posted on the hallway walls.\n\nOn it were instructions on how to use a console installed in the hallways to activate the Regenerator systems connected to the Safety Team.\n\n'This seems like it'd be worth a try.'\n\nIf we hurry, we might be able to activate the Regenerator before the Noon arrives.",
